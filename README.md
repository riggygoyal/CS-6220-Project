# CS-6220-Project MSCS Schedule Generator

A web application that allows a user to enter various inputs, then generates a schedule for the next semester based on such inputs


## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Python**: You need to have Python version 3.10.11 or higher installed on your machine. To check your Python version, you can run `python --version` in your terminal (or `python3 --version` on some systems). If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine.

## Installation
To set up your local development environment, please follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**
2. Navigate to the project directory and run this command "pip install -r requirements.txt"


## Running the Application

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Go to the project directory, in your terminal, run "python app.py"
2. Open up project.html on your local browser
3. Follow the instructions on the web app for your inputs, then click "Generate Schedule"
4. The backend will automatically receive those inputs and will generate the schedule. Give a couple of minutes to allow the genetic algorithm to process everything
